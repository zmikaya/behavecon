                        <p> Similarly, Table 2 summarizes the chance that Dam 2 
                            will fail based on whether one or more of conditions 
                            A, B, C, D, E, and F is currently present at Dam 2:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="bullet-points">
                          <li>If all six conditions are present at Dam 2, Dam 2
                              will fail with a 56% chance.

                              present but condition F is not), Dam 2 will
                              fail with a 43% chance.

                              (for example, conditions A, B, C, and D are
                              present but conditions E and F are not), Dam 2 will
                              fail with a 30% chance.

                              present but conditions D, E and F are not), Dam 2 
                              will fail with a 17% chance.

                          <li>If exactly two of the six conditions are present
                              (for example, conditions A and B are
                              present but conditions C, D, E and F are not), 
                              Dam 2 will fail with a 13% chance.
